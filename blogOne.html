         Ever wondered why some great achievers and leaders accomplish so much success in the same twenty-four hours that we all get every day?
         Most of us might think that they are all blessed with some superpower or talent but what if I tell you a secret that, they just know how to "manage their energy", think about it you have all the time in the world but don't have that energy to simply accomplish the task at hand. Maybe you are super lazy
         may be you feel tired all day or struggling with getting things done. If yes then, this guide is for you to boost your productivity by managing your energy. 
      </p>

      <h2>-levels of energy sources in Human beings</h2>
      <p>
        Human beings can perceive  energy at different levels, like muscular
        energy (gross energy), nervous energy (subtler than muscular energy), psychic energy (an intangible form of
        energy) and the final subtlest form of energy is Atman (infinite source of energy). The deeper the layer the
        subtler and more immense is the Energy Resource.
        
      </p>

      <h2>-level 1 <small>(muscular energy)</small></h2>
      <p>
        This is the outermost layer of the energy in Human beings. This is a limited energy source in human beings on given day. Professional bodybuiders use this level of energy ectensively whose focus is on the muscles.  
      </p>

      <h2>
        -level 2 <small>(nervous energy)</small>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Nervous energy is the result of additional cortisol and adrenaline in the body. These chemicals can be triggered by real or perceived threats. You may be experiencing increased nerves at the time exciting challenges or activities.
      </p>

      <h2>
        -level 3 <small>(psychic energy)</small>
      </h2>
      <p>
        According to Carl Jung, psychic energy cannot be measured quantitatively in terms of formulae as forms of physical energy can be. Psychic energy expresses itself in the form either of actual or of potential forces which perform psychological work. Perceiving, remembering, thinking, feeling, wishing, willing, attending, and striving are psychological activities just as breathing, digesting, and perspiring are physiological activities. Potential forces of the personality are such things as predispositions, latent tendencies, and inclinations. These potential or latent forces may be activated at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>
        -level 4<small>(Atman/the ultimate energy within)</small>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Atman. Atman means 'eternal self'. The atman refers to the real self beyond ego or false self. It is often referred to as 'spirit' or 'soul' and indicates our true self or essence which underlies our existence.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
